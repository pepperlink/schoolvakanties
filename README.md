# Israel School-Vacation with HomeAssistant Sensor Custom Component
## Get Israel School Vacation in HomeAssistant

This sensor checks whether today is a day off from school or not.
The sensor is divided into two types, elementary school and high school.
In Israel, the vacation begins on 22.06 in high school, while in elementary school the vacation begins on 01.07. 
Therefore there is a separation that allows the creation of separate automations for a school type.

It's very useful if you set a input_bolean in HA cause you can make automation that set if is vacation or not..
example :
```python
- id: Set_School_Mode_Off
  alias: Set School Mode Off
  trigger: 
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.school_is_elementary_vacation
    to: 'True'
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      entity_id: input_boolean.school_auto
    service: input_boolean.turn_off
 ```
 ## Guide How to use it
       
### Requirements
 * First need to create folder "school_holidays" in your HomeAssistant config /custom_components folder
* Copy python file "sensor.py , manifest.json , __init__.py " to the HA config /custom_components/school_holidays/ folder.
* Now you need to add those lines in HA sensor.yaml (if you separates your configs file)  /   :
 ```python
 - platform: school_holidays
   elementary_school: True
   high_school: True
   resources:
   - is_high_vacation
   - is_elementary_vacation
   - summary
  ```
  And if you want to use it with input_boolean here is the example to add to input_boolean.yaml file:
  ```python
  school_auto:
    name: School Mode
    icon: mdi:school
  ```
  Or if all yours HA configuration in configurtion.yaml file , use this example:
  ```python
  sensor:

      elementary_school: True
      high_school: True
      resources:
      - is_high_vacation
      - is_elementary_vacation
      - summary
